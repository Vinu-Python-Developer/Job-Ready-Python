# 🗺️ Treasure Finder - A Python Adventure Game

This is a beginner-friendly text-based game built during my 37-Day Python Confidence Journey.

The player walks through a set of locations and guesses where the treasure is hidden.

🧠 I built this game with guidance from ChatGPT — every line was written and understood by me.

This is my first step toward becoming a confident Python developer. 🌱✨
