# Habit Tracker 📝

Welcome to the **Habit Tracker** project! 🎉

This small Python program helps you reflect on your day by asking you to enter three tasks you completed. 
It then neatly lists your tasks and gives you a little encouragement to keep going. 💪🌟


## How it works:

- You input three things you did today, separated by commas. 📝
- The program splits your input and shows each task clearly. 🔍
- If you entered tasks, it cheers you on for your progress! 🎉👏
- If you forgot to enter tasks, it gently reminds you to try again. ⚠️

## Why this project?

Building small, practical programs like this helps improve your Python skills step-by-step — focusing on input handling,
string processing, and functions. 🐍💻
